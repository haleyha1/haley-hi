<h1>Movies</h1>
<h2>And food</h2>
<h3>This is a page on why movies and food are great</h3>
<h2>So lets start</h2>
<p><b>Movies</b> and <i>food</i> are a great combination and when they are not together also. They both provied a sense of comfort in a way, or at least for <em>me</em> but I feel like it's this way for many people.
 There are millions of movies and millions types of different types of food
so there is no reason to ever be bored and thats the great part because movies and food just solves so many problems for me. Food has been on the earth since day one but movies have have only been on earth since 1888 and that was only 133 years ago,
and when you go to the movies they have consession stands so you can get
food/drinks while you watch the movie and the most famous food to eat while watching a movie is popcorn</p>
